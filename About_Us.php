			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p><b>We make shopping for quality, healthy, and sustainable groceries simple and easy.</b><br>
		
				We're here to help you connect to and learn about the people who grow your food, 
				and to empower local producers by providing the online resource for learning 
				about their products and practices.</p>

			<h2>Our purpose</h2>
				<p><b>We aim to make our customers proud to shop with MyOnlineGroceryStore.</b><br>
				We're here to provide the very best grocery shopping experience — not just best online — best. Period.
					And we know that means different things to different people. 
					For some, it means not having to drive across town to the grocery store. 
					For others, it's about eating healthy and staying educated about where your food comes from and how it's made. 
					Or maybe it's about saving time so you can spend it doing the things you love with the people you care about.
					We're passionate about empowering you to live your ideal food life. 
					Know that we're listening to you, and ever moving towards that beautiful, 
					sunny island of grocery shopping perfection.</p>
			
				<p><b>We want to enrich the communities we live and work in.</b><br>
				
				When you shop with MyOnlineGroceryStore, you support your local food economy. 
					We partner directly with our local producers, 
					so there's no middle man getting a cut — just higher profits for the people making your food, 
					which allows them to maintain high standards for their practices. 
					We even use local produce to fulfill our orders for conventional,
					national produce options whenever possible, 
					ensuring we keep as many of your dollars in your local food economy as we can.
				</p>
				<p><b>We strive to create a rewarding atmosphere for our employees.</b><br>
			
				MyOnlineGroceryStore is a safe, honest and respectful place for all employees. 
					We encourage all of our employees to be, think and act like owners of the company.
					We encourage our employees to pursue their passions and interests, 
					both within the company, and in their personal lives. 
					We're passionate about offering excellent health care and benefits so our employees can live healthy and well.
				</p>	
				<p><b>We will return honest and fair profits to our investors.</b><br>
			
				We believe that focusing our efforts on our customers, 
					our communities and our employees will result in higher profitability 
					than we could achieve by focusing solely on profits. 
					By creating value for these three stakeholders, 
					we believe we will be able to return honest and fair profits to our investors.
